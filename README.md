## What is this

In this repo you can find the homework written by Neolux Lee at school of [CJLU](http://www.cjlu.edu.cn). All these code are written by [Neolux Lee (Click to go to the blog)](https://hello.neolux.ml).

If you want to learn from this code, you can download the code or use ```git clone```command to have a clone in your local computer.

The code are mainly written with MS VScode. For the single-chip microcomputer, I may use the Keil V5 to write code.

For C/C++, Java, I have included the executable file in the repo(C/C++: `.exe`; Java: `.java` or `.jar`) And for the single-chip microcomputer, I have also the `.hex` file included. 

The code for the single-chip microcomputer is totally written in C Programming Language.

At Last, If you download the code, you should include a copyright info at the header of your code/file using my code (no matter to hand in your homework or just to learn).
